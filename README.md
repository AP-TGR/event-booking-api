# Event Booking API

This is a RESTful API built with **Symfony 7** and **API Platform** to manage events, attendees, and bookings.

---

## üöÄ Features

* Create, update, delete, and list **events**
* Register and manage **attendees**
* **Book events** with attendee registration
* Prevent **duplicate** and **overbooked** bookings
* Designed with **clean architecture**, **validation**, and **error handling**
* Ready for future **authentication/authorization** integration

---

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema

* **Event**

  * `id`, `name`, `capacity`, `date`, `country`

* **Attendee**

  * `id`, `name`, `email`

* **Booking**

  * `id`, `bookedAt`, `event` (relation), `attendee` (relation)

---

## üîê Authentication & Authorization Design

> Authentication is not implemented but designed for future integration.

### Authentication (Planned)

* Use **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**
* Secure event/attendee management endpoints
* Allow public access to booking endpoints

### Authorization Rules

| Role         | Permissions                                                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Admin/User` | Create, update, delete, and list events and attendees (requires authentication) |
| `Attendee`   | Can book events anonymously (no authentication required)                        |

### Example Security Configuration (Planned)

```yaml
access_control:
    - { path: ^/api/bookings, roles: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY }
    - { path: ^/api, roles: ROLE_USER }
```
